# Personal website and blog at http://rikunert.com
I use Poole by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo) inspired by a [tutorial](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole) written by Joshua Lande.

# Top level pages
Top level pages are stored in the main folder and should include
- [index](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/blob/master/index.html) (the landing page)
- [about](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/blob/master/about.md)
- [publications](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/blob/master/publications.md)
- [archive](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/blob/master/archive.md)

# Blog posts
The blog posts, including still unpublished ones, are stored in the [posts folder](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/tree/master/_posts). This folder might contain work in progress.

# Pictures
The [pictures folder](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/tree/master/pictures) contains pictures which are not found, in this version, elsewhere on the web. It is mostly used for top level pages

# CV
The [CV](https://github.com/rikunert/rikunert.github.io/blob/master/cv.md) is a work in progress and might not be published at this point in time.
